# Watemark GUI Application

This applications allow users to upload multiple images and watermarks to make combinations. The main features include uploading multiple base images and watermarks, combining different uploads and visualizing the results live from the GUI, changing the positoin of the watermark, changing the opacity of the watermark (both of which may be visualized as they are implemented). The only things I omitted were resizing the images to their original size after adding the watermark and adding a slicer to resize the watermark in the picture.
